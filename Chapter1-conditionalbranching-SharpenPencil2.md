# ✏️ Sharpen Your Pencil 2 — Conditional Branching

**Chapter 1 | Head First Java, 3rd Edition**  
**Points:** 20

## Background Reading

In Java, an `if` test works just like the boolean test in a `while` loop — except instead of repeating, it branches.

### Example 1 — Simple `if`

```java
class IfTest {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int x = 3;
        if (x == 3) {
            System.out.println("x must be 3");
        }
        System.out.println("This runs no matter what");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
x must be 3
This runs no matter what
```

### Example 2 — `if / else`

```java
class IfTest2 {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int x = 2;
        if (x == 3) {
            System.out.println("x must be 3");
        } else {
            System.out.println("x is NOT 3");
        }
        System.out.println("This runs no matter what");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
x is NOT 3
This runs no matter what
```

### `System.out.print` vs. `System.out.println`

| Method | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `System.out.print()` | Prints on the **same line** — no newline added |
| `System.out.println()` | Prints and then moves to a **new line** |

## ✏️ Your Turn — Fill in the Missing Code

The program below should produce this exact output when run:

```
DoobeeDoobeeDo
```

Fill in the two blanks (`____`) so the program produces that output.

```java
public class Doobee {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int x = 1;
        while (x < ____ ) {
            System.out.print("Do");
            System.out.print("Bee");
            x = x + 1;
        }
        if (x == ____ ) {
            System.out.print("Do");
        }
    }
}
```

**Blank 1** — `while (x < ____ )` — What value goes here?  
> ___________

**Blank 2** — `if (x == ____ )` — What value goes here?  
> ___________

## 🧠 Explanation Questions

**Question 1** — How many times does the `while` loop run? Show your reasoning.  
> ___________

**Question 2** — Why does "Do" print one extra time at the end (after the loop)?  
> ___________

**Question 3** — What would the output be if you changed `System.out.print` to `System.out.println` inside the `while` loop? Describe the difference.  
> ___________

**Question 4** — What is the value of `x` when the `if` statement is evaluated? How do you know?  
> ___________

## Grading Breakdown (20 pts)

| Item | Criteria | Points |
|---|---|---|
| Blank 1 — `while` condition value | Correct number | 4 pts |
| Blank 2 — `if` condition value | Correct number | 4 pts |
| Question 1 — Loop iteration count + reasoning | Correct count with explanation | 3 pts |
| Question 2 — Why extra "Do" prints | Correct explanation of `if` after loop | 3 pts |
| Question 3 — `println` vs `print` output difference | Accurate description | 3 pts |
| Question 4 — Value of `x` at `if` + reasoning | Correct value with explanation | 3 pts |
| **Total** | | **20 pts** |

> **Partial credit:** Answers that show correct reasoning but arrive at the wrong value earn half credit.
